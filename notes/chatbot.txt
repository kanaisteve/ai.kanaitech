1. fix the ChatBot component. a few issues:
========================================

    1. The state hooks and handleSend function are defined outside the component, which is incorrect
    2. The component structure needs to be fixed

    Made several important changes to fix the ChatBot component:
        1. Added the missing `import { useState } from 'react';` at the top
        2. Moved the state hooks (`useState`) inside the component function
        3. Moved the `handleSend` function inside the component
        4. Added `fixed` positioning with `bottom-4 right-4` to make the chatbot appear in the bottom right corner
        5. Added `shadow-lg` for better visibility
        6. Added Enter key support for sending messages

    These changes should make the ChatBot component appear and function correctly 
    on the screen. The chatbot will now be visible in the bottom 
    right corner of the page with a proper layout and styling.



2. Enhance the ChatBot component to add a chat button with an icon and show/hide functionality. 
==================================================================================================
    First, we'll need to add a state for visibility and create a toggle button. 

    Made improvements:

    1. Added a `isOpen` state to control the visibility of the chat window
    2. Created a chat button with a message icon that appears when the chat is closed
    3. Added a close button in the chat header
    4. Improved the overall styling:
    - Added a header with a title
    - Better spacing and padding
    - Fixed width for better appearance
    - Added z-index to ensure it appears above other content
    - Shadow effects for better visibility
    - Hover effects on buttons

    Now the ChatBot will:
    1. Initially show only a chat button with an icon
    2. Open the chat window when the button is clicked
    3. Close when the X button in the header is clicked
    4. Hide the chat button when the chat window is open

    The chat functionality remains the same, but the UI is now more polished and user-friendly. 
    Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the styling or behavior!


3. ChatBot to automatically scroll to the latest messages.
=======================================================

    To modify the ChatBot to automatically scroll to the latest messages. 
    We'll need to add a reference to the messages container and use useEffect 
    to scroll to the bottom whenever messages change. 
    ````

    Made the following enhancements to make sure the latest messages are always visible:

    1. Added `useRef` and `useEffect` imports from React
    2. Created a `messagesEndRef` using `useRef` to reference the bottom of the messages container
    3. Added a `scrollToBottom` function that smoothly scrolls to the latest message
    4. Added a `useEffect` hook that triggers the scroll whenever new messages are added
    5. Added an empty div with the `messagesEndRef` at the bottom of the messages container

    Now whenever:
    - A new message is sent or received
    - The chat window is opened
    - Messages are loaded

    The chat will automatically scroll to show the most recent messages with a smooth animation. 
    This provides a better user experience as users won't have to manually scroll to see new messages.

    You can continue using the chat as before, but now it will always keep the latest messages in view!


4. ChatBot to display an initial welcome message when the chat is opened
=====================================================================

    We'll need to adjust the initial state of messages and add a useEffect for when the chat opens. 

    Made changes.

    I've made the following enhancements:

    1. Added a `WELCOME_MESSAGE` constant with the initial greeting message
    2. Added a new `useEffect` hook that triggers when the chat opens (`isOpen` changes)
    3. When the chat opens and there are no messages, it adds the welcome message
    4. Added a check in `handleSend` to prevent sending empty messages
    5. The welcome message includes an emoji to make it more friendly and engaging

    Now when users open the chat, they'll immediately see:
    "Hi! I'm Kisu, Kanaitech AI sales expert ðŸ¤–. How can I help you today?"

    This provides a better user experience by:
    - Immediately engaging the user
    - Making it clear it's an AI assistant
    - Setting expectations about the bot's capabilities (sales expert)
    - Using an emoji to make it more friendly and modern

    The message will appear every time the chat is opened if there are no existing messages. 
    All other functionality remains the same!


5. Add Quick Suggestion Buttons That Appear at the Bottom of the Chat 
==================================================================
    Let's quick suggestion buttons to make it easier for users to ask common questions. 
    ```

    Made the following enhancements:

    1. Added quick suggestion buttons that appear at the bottom of the chat, above the input field
    2. The buttons are displayed only when there's just the welcome message (messages.length <= 1)
    3. Each button:
    - Uses a clean, minimal design with a white background and gray border
    - Shows one of the FAQ questions
    - When clicked:
        - Fills the input with the question
        - Immediately sends the message and gets the response
    4. The buttons have a nice hover effect and are styled to look like chips/tags
    5. Uses flex-wrap to handle multiple buttons nicely in the available space

    Now when users open the chat, they'll see:
    1. The welcome message
    2. Quick suggestion buttons for all FAQ questions
    3. The regular input field and send button below

    Once they click a suggestion or send their first message, 
    the suggestion buttons will disappear to keep the interface clean. 
    This provides a more guided experience for new users while maintaining the flexibility of free-form input.


6. Show only 3-4 of the most common/important questions as quick suggestion buttons.
====================================================================================
    Made the following changes:

    1. Removed the `setInput(question)` since it's not needed (we're sending the question directly)
    2. Added `setInput('')` at the end of the click handler to clear the input field

    Now when you click a suggestion button:
    1. The question will be sent immediately
    2. The response will be shown
    3. The input field will be cleared
    4. The suggestion buttons will disappear (since messages.length will be > 1)

    The behavior is now consistent with the regular send button functionality!


    You make an excellent point! Having buttons for all FAQ questions isn't scalable, especially with a large FAQ database. Let me recommend a better approach:

    ### Recommended Solution
    Show only 3-4 of the most common/important questions as quick suggestion buttons. Here's how to modify the code:

    ````jsx
    // Add this constant at the top with your most important FAQs
    const SUGGESTED_QUESTIONS = [
        "What is Kanai Technologies?",
        "What services do you offer?",
        "How do I contact support?"
    ];

    // Then modify the button mapping section
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
        {messages.length <= 1 && SUGGESTED_QUESTIONS.map((question, index) => (
            <button
                key={index}
                onClick={() => {
                    const userMsg = { text: question, from: 'user' };
                    const botMsg = { text: faqs[question], from: 'bot' };
                    setMessages([...messages, userMsg, botMsg]);
                    setInput('');
                }}
                className="px-3 py-1.5 text-sm bg-white hover:bg-gray-50 text-gray-700 rounded-full border border-gray-300 transition-colors"
            >
                {question}
            </button>
        ))}
    </div>
    ````

    ### Benefits of this approach:
    1. **Better UX**: Less overwhelming for users
    2. **Mobile-friendly**: Fewer buttons means better fit on small screens
    3. **Focused guidance**: Directs users to the most important information first
    4. **Scalable**: Works well even if your FAQ database grows
    5. **Maintainable**: Easier to manage and update priority questions

    You could also consider rotating these suggestions based on:
    - Most frequently asked questions
    - Current promotions or campaigns
    - Seasonal relevance
    - User context (if available)
