fix the ChatBot component. a few issues:
========================================

1. The state hooks and handleSend function are defined outside the component, which is incorrect
2. The component structure needs to be fixed

Let me fix these issues: 
````


Made changes.

I've made several important changes to fix the ChatBot component:

1. Added the missing `import { useState } from 'react';` at the top
2. Moved the state hooks (`useState`) inside the component function
3. Moved the `handleSend` function inside the component
4. Added `fixed` positioning with `bottom-4 right-4` to make the chatbot appear in the bottom right corner
5. Added `shadow-lg` for better visibility
6. Added Enter key support for sending messages

These changes should make the ChatBot component appear and function correctly 
on the screen. The chatbot will now be visible in the bottom 
right corner of the page with a proper layout and styling.




I'll enhance the ChatBot component to add a chat button with an icon and show/hide functionality. 
==================================================================================================

First, we'll need to add a state for visibility and create a toggle button. 

Made improvements:

1. Added a `isOpen` state to control the visibility of the chat window
2. Created a chat button with a message icon that appears when the chat is closed
3. Added a close button in the chat header
4. Improved the overall styling:
   - Added a header with a title
   - Better spacing and padding
   - Fixed width for better appearance
   - Added z-index to ensure it appears above other content
   - Shadow effects for better visibility
   - Hover effects on buttons

Now the ChatBot will:
1. Initially show only a chat button with an icon
2. Open the chat window when the button is clicked
3. Close when the X button in the header is clicked
4. Hide the chat button when the chat window is open

The chat functionality remains the same, but the UI is now more polished and user-friendly. 
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the styling or behavior!


ChatBot to automatically scroll to the latest messages.
=======================================================

To modify the ChatBot to automatically scroll to the latest messages. 
We'll need to add a reference to the messages container and use useEffect 
to scroll to the bottom whenever messages change. 
````

Made the following enhancements to make sure the latest messages are always visible:

1. Added `useRef` and `useEffect` imports from React
2. Created a `messagesEndRef` using `useRef` to reference the bottom of the messages container
3. Added a `scrollToBottom` function that smoothly scrolls to the latest message
4. Added a `useEffect` hook that triggers the scroll whenever new messages are added
5. Added an empty div with the `messagesEndRef` at the bottom of the messages container

Now whenever:
- A new message is sent or received
- The chat window is opened
- Messages are loaded

The chat will automatically scroll to show the most recent messages with a smooth animation. 
This provides a better user experience as users won't have to manually scroll to see new messages.

You can continue using the chat as before, but now it will always keep the latest messages in view!


ChatBot to display an initial welcome message when the chat is opened
=====================================================================

I'll modify the ChatBot to display an initial welcome message when the chat is opened. We'll need to adjust the initial state of messages and add a useEffect for when the chat opens.

````


Made changes.

I've made the following enhancements:

1. Added a `WELCOME_MESSAGE` constant with the initial greeting message
2. Added a new `useEffect` hook that triggers when the chat opens (`isOpen` changes)
3. When the chat opens and there are no messages, it adds the welcome message
4. Added a check in `handleSend` to prevent sending empty messages
5. The welcome message includes an emoji to make it more friendly and engaging

Now when users open the chat, they'll immediately see:
"Hi! I'm Kisu, Kanaitech AI sales expert ðŸ¤–. How can I help you today?"

This provides a better user experience by:
- Immediately engaging the user
- Making it clear it's an AI assistant
- Setting expectations about the bot's capabilities (sales expert)
- Using an emoji to make it more friendly and modern

The message will appear every time the chat is opened if there are no existing messages. All other functionality remains the same!
