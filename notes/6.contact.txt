The contact page already has good styling using Tailwind CSS, but I notice a few areas where we can enhance the user experience and visual appeal:

1. Let's add form state management
2. Add loading state for the submit button
3. Add form validation
4. Add success/error notifications
5. Make the form submission interactive

Here's how we'll enhance it:

Made changes.

I've enhanced the contact page with several improvements:

1. Added form state management using `useState`
2. Added form validation with required fields (marked with red asterisks)
3. Added a loading state for the submit button with a spinner
4. Added success/error notifications that appear after form submission
5. Added proper form handling with controlled components
6. Enhanced input validation with visual feedback
7. Added proper HTML5 validation attributes
8. Improved accessibility with required field indicators
9. Added transitions and hover states
10. Added proper phone input type and email validation
11. Added loading state disabling for the submit button
12. Added proper form reset after successful submission

The form now has:
- Visual feedback for required fields
- Client-side validation
- Loading states
- Success/error notifications
- Proper form state management
- Improved accessibility
- Better user experience with visual feedback
- Proper form handling
- Simulated API call (you can replace the timeout with your actual API call)

The styling has been enhanced while maintaining the clean, professional look of the original design. All the Tailwind classes have been preserved and enhanced where needed. The form is now fully interactive and provides proper feedback to users.
