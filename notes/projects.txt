I'll help you enhance the Projects page by creating a ProjectCard component and modifying the existing page structure. I'll first read the full file to ensure I have all the context I need.

I'll create a ProjectCard component and update the Projects component to display actual projects instead of services. I'll make these changes in the same file.

Made changes.

I've enhanced the Projects page with the following changes:

1. Created a new `ProjectCard` component that displays:
   - Client logo (with proper image container and styling)
   - Project category (in red, matching the brand color)
   - Project title (larger, bold text)
   - Project excerpt (description of the work done)
   - Client name (in a clean, professional format)

2. Updated the Projects component to:
   - Display a grid of project cards (3 columns on large screens, 2 on medium screens)
   - Include sample project data with diverse categories
   - Use more appropriate heading text for a projects showcase
   - Maintain consistent spacing and styling with the rest of the site

3. Styling improvements:
   - Added shadow effects with hover animation
   - Used consistent color scheme (red accent color)
   - Maintained responsive grid layout
   - Added proper spacing and padding
   - Optimized image container for logos

Note: You'll need to add actual client logo images to the `/images/clients/` directory with the appropriate filenames (client1.png through client6.png). You should replace the sample project data with your actual project information.

Would you like me to help you set up the image directory for the client logos as well?
